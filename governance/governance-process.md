# Governance Process

## Overview
This document describes the lifecycle of a proposal from idea to execution.

1. Drafting & Discussion
   - Proposers draft proposals in the governance folder and open a discussion on the community forum or GitHub Discussions.
2. Community Review
   - The community provides feedback; authors update the proposal accordingly.
3. Formal Submission
   - Once ready, the proposal is submitted for on-chain voting using the DAO's voting contract.
4. Voting
   - Voting period runs for a predefined duration. Results are recorded on-chain.
5. Execution
   - If approved, the proposal is executed on-chain or by designated stewards following the implementation plan.
6. Post-implementation Reporting
   - Outcomes and any follow-ups are documented.

## Emergency measures
For critical security or custodial events, emergency proposals with faster timelines and elevated privileges may be enacted according to rules set by the DAO.
