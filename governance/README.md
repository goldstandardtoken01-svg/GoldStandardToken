# Governance
Governance model:  
- 1 GST = 1 vote (with delegation).  
- Token holders can delegate their voting power to trusted representatives.  
- Governance contracts manage proposals, voting, and execution.

Proposal lifecycle:

1. Draft: Community discussion off-chain (forum, Discord, etc.).  
2. Submission: On-chain proposal after reaching a minimum threshold (e.g., 0.5% of total supply delegated).  
3. Voting: Open voting window (e.g., 5–7 days).  
4. Timelock: Delay (e.g., 48–72 hours) before execution.  
5. Execution: Smart contract executes the approved changes.

What governance controls:

- Smart contract upgrades (where allowed)  
- Treasury allocations and grants  
- Emission and reward parameters  
- Partnerships and integrations  
- Ecosystem roadmaps and priorities
