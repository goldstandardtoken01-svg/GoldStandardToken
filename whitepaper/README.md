1. Introduction

Problem:  
Existing governance/utility tokens often suffer from weak real-world utility, poor distribution, and capture by early insiders.

Vision:  
Gold Standard Token (GST) is a governance and utility asset on Ethereum designed to embody a simple principle: excellence as a system, not a slogan. GST coordinates contributors, capital, and decisions across an ecosystem that values long-term alignment over speculation.

Mission:  
To build a community-governed network where GST grants both a voice (governance) and a role (utility) in shaping and using real products and services.
