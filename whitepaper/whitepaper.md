# Gold Standard Token — Whitepaper

## Abstract
Gold Standard Token (GST) is a digital asset designed to combine the transparency and liquidity of tokenized crypto assets with a long-term, scarcity-driven reserve strategy backed by diversified real-world assets. GST aims to provide a durable digital store of value, an on-chain medium for governance, and programmable primitives for DeFi integration.

## Motivation
Current stablecoins emphasize price stability; many digital assets emphasize utility or speculation. GST aims to establish a resilient, governance-led store of value that aligns incentives between long-term holders, contributors, and real-world reserve stewards.

## Design principles
- Transparency: on-chain issuance and public accounting for reserve allocations.
- Durability: conservative reserve management and multi-custodian holdings.
- Governance: DAO-led decisions for reserve changes, integrations, and protocol upgrades.
- Interoperability: standards-compliant token contract(s) and easy integration with DeFi.

## Token mechanics (overview)
GST is an ERC-20 compatible token with optional governance extensions. Token issuance and burning are governed by DAO proposals and smart contracts that reflect reserve-backed mint/burn policies.

## Reserves
Reserves consist of diversified, audited real-world assets (e.g., allocated gold ETFs, certified physical bullion in custodians, low-volatility financial instruments). Reserve reports and proofs will be published periodically.

## Governance
A decentralized governance model coordinates protocol changes, reserve policy, and treasury allocation. The DAO constitution defines member rights, proposal flows, and voting thresholds.

## Roadmap & milestones
1. Launch repository, governance charter, and tokenomics (current).
2. Deploy initial smart contract and audit code.
3. Establish reserve partners and custody arrangements.
4. Community-driven governance and ecosystem integrations.

## Conclusion
GST is intended as a cautious, governance-driven project combining tokenized advantages with real-world reserve backing. The project will prioritize transparency, security, and long-term value preservation.
