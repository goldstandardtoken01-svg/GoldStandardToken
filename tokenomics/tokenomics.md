# Tokenomics

## Total supply
- Initial supply: 1,000,000 GST (example — subject to governance approval)
- Cap & issuance: any change to cap or issuance rules requires a DAO proposal and vote.

## Allocation (example)
- 60% — Community reserve & distribution
- 15% — Treasury (operations, partnerships)
- 10% — Team (vesting)
- 10% — Ecosystem grants and incentives
- 5% — Advisors and early contributors

## Vesting and cliffs
- Team allocation vests over 48 months with a 12-month cliff.
- Advisor tokens vest over 24 months with a 6-month cliff.

## Distribution mechanisms
- Community distributions may include a mix of airdrops, liquidity mining, and on-chain auctions.
- Any non-trivial distribution program must be approved by governance.

## Treasury management
- Treasury funds will be used for development, operations, reserve purchases, and ecosystem growth.
- Treasury allocations and spendings are subject to on-chain proposals and public reporting.

## Economic considerations
- Inflation schedule, utility incentives, and reserve scaling are parameters to be tuned by governance.
- Risk management and reserve rebalancing rules will be codified and audited.
