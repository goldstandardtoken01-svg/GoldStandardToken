# DAO Constitution

## Purpose
The DAO exists to steward the Gold Standard Token protocol, manage reserves, allocate treasury resources, and coordinate community-driven development.

## Membership
- Membership is granted to addresses that hold GST or are otherwise recognized by DAO governance rules.
- Membership rights and proposal thresholds may be adjusted by governance.

## Proposal and voting
- Any member may submit a proposal following the governance process.
- Standard proposals require a quorum and a supermajority (examples: quorum = 5% of supply, approval = 60%). Specific thresholds are configurable via governance.

## Roles
- Stewards: elected or appointed roles to manage day-to-day tasks.
- Auditors: independent entities responsible for reserve attestations.

## Amendments
- This constitution may be amended by the DAO following the proposal and voting process with a higher approval threshold for constitutional changes.

## Transparency and reporting
- Reserve reports, treasury transactions, and audit statements must be published on a regular cadence.
