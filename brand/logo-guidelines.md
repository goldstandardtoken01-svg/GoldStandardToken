# Logo Guidelines

## Logo versions
- Full logo: wordmark + emblem
- Emblem only: square or circular mark for avatars
- Wordmark only: horizontal lockup for headers

## Clearspace & sizing
- Maintain a minimum clearspace equal to the height of the emblem.
- Minimum digital logo height: 24px for emblem-only, 32px for wordmark.

## Color usage
- Use the primary gold on dark or light backgrounds with sufficient contrast.
- Provide monochrome black and white versions for high-contrast contexts.

## Don’ts
- Do not stretch, rotate, or recolor the logo outside the approved palette.
- Do not add drop shadows or effects that compromise legibility.
